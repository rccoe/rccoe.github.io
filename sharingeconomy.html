<h2>
  Lab: The Sharing Economy
</h2>

<p>In this lab, we won't be using Scratch. Instead, we will be researching several peer-to-peer and sharing companies and writing about what each of these companies does.</p>

<p>In addition to the websites linked to below, you may find the following articles helpful in learning about the sharing economy. (These articles are also a good place to find examples of companies!)</p>

  <li>Choose two of the following companies. For each company, answer the following questions: What do they do? When was the company started? How does sharing play into their business?

    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Now, try to find another sharing company not on the above list. What is the name of the company? What do they do? Would you consider using this company's product? Why or why not?</li>

  <li>Companies like Airbnb have been the target of government regulators, who say that Airbnb hosts must pay taxes just like any hotel that takes money in exchange for letting guests stay. Do you agree or disagree with the government's position? Why? Please use evidence and examples from the articles above.</li>
